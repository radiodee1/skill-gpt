The "real you".	10
What good stuff?	11
I figured you'd get to	12
Thank God!	13
Me.	14
What crap?	15
do you listen to this	16
No.	17
Then Guillermo says, "If you	18
You always been this selfish?	19
But	20
Then that's all you had	21
Well, no.	22
You never wanted to go	23
I was?	24
I looked for you back	25
Tons	26
Have fun tonight?	27
I believe we share an	28
You know Chastity?	29

Right.	52
C'esc ma tete.	53
Let me see what I	54
Gosh, if only we could	55
That's a shame.	56
Unsolved mystery.	57
Why?	58
Seems like she could get	59
The thing is, Cameron --	60
Cameron.	61
No, no, it's my fault	62
Forget it.	63
You're asking me out.	64
Okay.	65
Not the hacking and gagging	66
Well, I thought we'd start	67
Can we make this quick?	68
I did.	69
You think you ' re	70
I don't have to be	71
I have to be home	72
All I know is --	73
Sometimes I wonder if the	74
Bianca, I don't think the	75
Combination.	76
Is he oily or dry?	77
He practically proposed when he	78
Would you mind getting me	79
Great	80
Joey.	81
Who?	82
Where did he go?	83
You might wanna think about	84
No.	85
Did you change your hair?	86
You know the deal.	87
Listen, I want to talk	88
You're concentrating awfully hard considering	89
Hi, Joey.	90

I just wanted --	107
You set me up.	108
Let go!	109
So did you	110
You looked beautiful last night,	111
I guess I'll never know,	112
Not all experiences are good,	113
God, you're just like him!	114
I guess I thought I	115
I'm not stupid enough to	116
That's not	117
No.	118
I wanted to let you	119
Why didn't you tell me?	120
After that, I swore I'd	121
But	122
Just once.	123
You did what?	124
He said everyone was doing	125
As in.	126
Now I do.	127
But you hate Joey	128
He was, like, a total	129
Why?	130
In 9th.	131
What?	132
Joey never told you we	133
I wish I had that	134
I do care.	135
Like you care.	136
Listen, I know you hate	137
You're welcome.	138
I don't get you.	139
I really don't think I	140
Bianca, I need to talk	141
Can we go now?	142
You are so completely unbalanced.	143
Yeah, he's your freak friend	144
It's Shakespeare.	145
Like I'm supposed to know	146
At least I'm not a	147
Can't you forget for just	148
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal,	149
What's normal?	150
You're ruining my life'	151
I think you're a freak.	152
What do you think?	153
Oh, I thought you might	154
It means that Gigglepuss is	155
Oh my God, does this	156
Can you at least start	157
I have the potential to	158
Nowhere.	159
Where've you been?	160
I have a date, Daddy.	161
I'm missing something.	162
Fine.	163
You're not going unless your	164
He's not a "hot rod".	165
It's that hot rod Joey,	166
No, but	167
The prom?	168
Daddy, I want to discuss	169
Because she'll scare them away.	170
Why?	171
Promise me you won't talk	172
Just for a minute	173
Daddy, no!	174
Wear the belly before you	175
It's just a party.	176
Oh, God.	177
If Kat's not going, you're	178
Daddy, people expect me to	179
It's just a party.	180
Otherwise known as an orgy?	181
If you must know, we	182
And where're you going?	183
Daddy, I --	184
Exactly my point	185
But she doesn't want to	186
But it's not fair --	187
Then neither will you.	188
What if she never starts	189
No!	190
Now don't get upset.	191
Just sent 'em through.	192
Padua girls.	193
Never	194
Fan of a fan.	195
Didn't have you pegged for	196
Always a pleasure, Brucie.	197
Best case scenario, you're back	198
You humiliated the woman!	199
No, I ' m not.	200
Buttholus extremus.	201
The hell is that?	202
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.	203
Hell, I've just been going	204

Assail your ears for one	207
Okay!	208

Her favorite uncle	211

Will Bogey get bent?	215
In that case, we'll need	216
This is it.	217
Like we had a choice?	218
You got him involved?	219
Hey -- I've gotta have	220
I thought you hated those	221
You know, if you do	222
That's what I just said	223

Forget his reputation.	225
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.	226
They always let felons sit	227
No kidding.	228
He seems like he thrives	229
What makes you think he'll	230
You wanna go out with	231

Unlikely, but even so, she	233
I teach her French, get	234
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.	235
That's her?	236
Yeah, just a minor encounter	237
You could consecrate with her,	238

Guess who just signed up	240
Sure do .	241
You know French?	242
Joey Dorsey?	243
He always have that shit-eating	244

Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow	284
So what does that give	285
Okay -- Likes:  Thai	286

Enough with the Barbie n'	301
I don't know, Dorsey.	302
Get her to act like	303
Do what?	304
How'd you do it?	305
A deal's a deal.	306
It's about time.	307
Forget her sister, then.	308
Forget it.	309
A hundred bucks a date.	310
What?	311
I just upped my price	312
I got her under control.	313
Watching the bitch trash my	314
I'm on it	315
When I shell out fifty,	316
Fifty, and you've got your	317
Take it or leave it.	318
Fine, thirty.	319
I can't take a girl	320
How much?	321
I can't date her sister	322
You're gonna pay me to	323
You got it, Verona.	324
But you'd go out with	325
You need money to take	326
You just said	327
Sure, Sparky.	328

Two legs, nice rack.	330

So what you need to	339
Does this conversation have a	340

We don't chat.	344
Nope - just came by	345
Are you lost?	346
Hey.	347
Oh, honey -- tell me	348
William - he asked me	349
Who?	350
Have you seen him?	351
Oh, good.	352
You ' re looking at	353
Okay, okay, we won't go.	354
Listen to you!	355
Well, I guess we're not,	356
Can you even imagine?	357
I got drunk.	358
You didn't	359
I did Bianca a favor	360
You didn't have a choice?	361
I didn't have a choice.	362
You went to the party?	363
Who cares?	364
What'd he say?	365
No fear.	366
You think this'll work?	367
If I was Bianca, it	368
Does it matter?	369
I appreciate your efforts toward	370
Neither has his heterosexuality.	371
That's never been proven	372
William didn't even go to	373
William would never have gone	374
So he has this huge	375
You could always go with	376
The people at this school	377
But imagine the things he'd	378
I realize that the men	379
An attempted slit.	380
What's this?	381
Just a little.	382
Mandella, eat.	383
Block E?	384
He always look so	385
I'm sure he's completely incapable	386
That's Pat Verona?	387
Patrick Verona   Random	388
Who's that?	389
Don ' t you even	390
Oh, Bianca?	391
Because I like to torture	392
Why is my veggie burger	393
Yeah, but then I fucked	394
Is that right?	395
Besides, I had some extra	396
I thought you could use	397
A Fender Strat.	398
I didn't care about the	399
Really?	400
It wasn't like that.	401
You were paid to take	402
Wait I.	403
It gets worse -- you	404
That ' s completely adorable!	405
That's where I was last	406
What?	407
My grandmother's .	408
Look, I'm  -- sorry	409
Oh huh	410
It's just something I had.	411
It's Scurvy's.	412
How'd you get a tux	413
Nothing!	414
Answer the question, Patrick	415
You need therapy.	416
You tell me.	417
So I have to have	418
Create a little drama?	419
Because I don't want to.	420
Why not?	421
No, I won't go with	422
No what?	423
No.	424
You know what I mean	425
Is that a request or	426
Go to the prom with	427
You're amazingly self-assured.	428
No one else knows	429
What?	430
You're sweet.	431
No -- something real.	432
I hate peas.	433
Tell me something true.	434
I know the porn career's	435
Hearsay.	436
The duck?	437
Fallacy.	438
State trooper?	439
For.	440
You up for it?	441
You never disappointed me.	442
How?	443
Then you screwed up	444
Something like that	445
So if you disappoint them	446
I don't like to do	447
Yes	448
Acting the way we do.	449
So what's your excuse?	450
Yeah, well, don't let it	451
A soft side?	452
I dazzled him with my	453
So how'd you get Chapin	454
Good call.	455
I figured it had to	456
The Partridge Family?	457
Maybe.	458
You want me to climb	459
Forget it.	460
Put your right foot there	461
Try lookin' at it from	462
C'mon.	463
I guess I never told	464
Look up, sunshine	465
He left!	466
Other than my upchuck reflex?	467
So what did I have	468
Don't for one minute think	469
Unwelcome?	470
Unwelcome.	471
Wholesome.	472
Pleasant?	473
You 're so --	474
I heard there was a	475
What are you doing here?	476
Excuse me, have you seen	477
No offense, but you're sister	478
BIANCA	479
Who?	480
He just wants me to	481
So what ' s up	482
I'm gettin' there	483
Oh, so now you think	484
You don't strike me as	485
My father wouldn't approve of	486
Start a band?	487
This.	488
Do what?	489
I should do this.	490
Why'd you lie?	491
Then why'd you ask?	492
No, you weren't	493
Maybe.	494
Were you in jail?	495
Busy	496
When you were gone last	497
But it's Gigglepuss - I	498
And I'm in control of	499
What?	500
Kat!	501
You know what they say	502
I thought you were above	503
Hey man.	504
I know.	505
I hate him.	506
Dorsey.	507
Who?	508
Why'd you let him get	509
Just let me sit down.	510
See that?	511
Like you could find one	512
Because then I'd have to	513
Why?	514
Sure, I do	515
You don't care if I	516
I told you	517
Why 're you doing this?	518
Leave it to you to	519
This is so patronizing.	520
What if you have a	521
I know, just let me	522
Uh, uh.	523
I just need to lie	524
You're not okay.	525
I'm fine.	526
Okay?	527
Funny, you're the only one	528
I say, do what you	529
"I'm getting trashed, man.	530
What's this?	531
Why, don't you?	532
You know who The Raincoats	533
You know, these guys are	534
Do you mind?	535
That's what you want, isn't	536
Excuse me?	537
hey.	538
Depends on the topic.	539
You're not a big talker,	540
Hi	541
I was in the laundromat.	542
Are you following me?	543
Seven-thirty?	544
You -- covered in my	545
Come on -- the ponies,	546
And why would I do	547
Then say you'll spend Dollar	548
I don't really think you	549
You hate me don't you?	550
I know a lot more	551
Like where?	552
The night I take you	553
Oh, right.	554
Pick you up Friday, then	555
My mission in life.	556
There's a way to get	557
Sweating like a pig, actually.	558
I mean Wo-man.	559
Oh, Christ.	560
When I go?	561
You know, fathers don't like	562
No -- impressed.	563
What's the matter?	564
Bianca did what?	565
The part where Bianca beat	566
Which parts?	567
Parts of it.	568
So tell me about this	569
No, Daddy.	570
I don't understand the allure	571
Funny.	572
Yeah.	573
Was that your sister?	574
I want to go to	575
You're eighteen.	576
So what I want doesn't	577
As a parent, that's my	578
Because you're making decisions for	579
Why can't we agree on	580
I thought you were punishing	581
Is this about Sarah Lawrence?	582
Then tell them I had	583
My insurance does not cover	584
Enough!	585
This from someone whose diary	586
You decided.	587
I thought we decided you	588
I know.	589
Just smack her now.	590
Am I supposed to feel	591
No .	592
Tempestuous?	593
The point is Kat --	594
I still maintain that he	595
Well, yes, compared to your	596
Expressing my opinion is not	597
Katarina Stratford.	598
Yeah.	599
Kat a fan, too?	600
Right.	601
Macbeth, right?	602
Oh yeah.	603
You think?	604
Yeah.	605
Cool pictures.	606
Hi.	607
Hey there.	608

Just for now.	618
Are you telling me I'm	619
Good enough.	620
What?	621
We're your guys.	622
You two are gonna help	623
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking	624
So Dorsey can get the	625
That's where we can help	626
Dorsey can plow whoever he	627
I think I speak correctly	628
What is it with this	629
The situation is, my man	630
What plan?	631
Whatever the hell it is	632
What?	633
Say it	634
See you next week!	635
You're completely demented.	636
Well, you know -- there's	637
You weren't abused, you aren't	638
What's to discuss?	639
Why don't we discuss your	640
I'm at a loss, then.	641
Touch of the flu.	642
I don't understand, Patrick.	643
With the teeth of your	644
It was a bratwurst.	645
It says here you exposed	646
I missed you.	647
That ' s what I	648
Absolutely not.	649
Did I have anything to	650
Your daughters went to the	651
What just happened?	652
But -- who -- what	653
Have a great time, honey!	654
Dr.	655
What do you wanna watch?	656
Kissing?	657
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll	658
Pirate -- no question.	659
Would you rather be ravished	660
You're not helping.	661
Tumescent!	662
Jesus!	663
Sarah Lawrence is on the	664
What's a synonym for throbbing?	665
Make anyone cry today?	666
In the microwave.	667
Can't be that far, I	668
We left three weeks ago,	669
We should have seen land.	670
We'll all go crazy.	671
He's the devil's child.	672
With a face like that?	673
Ah, leave him alone.	674
What are you listening to,	675
You'll be drinking your own	676
The water's going putrid in	677
I never seen heat like	678
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!	679
Asia can be found to	680
Blind faith is what I	681
Don't you realize your words	682
Did He not choose a	683
If God intended our proximity	684
No.	685
Is that all that interests	686
Trade, Your Excellency.	687
If they agree to follow	688
Your life, and that of	689
Your Eminence, there is only	690
Excellency, you are right.	691
Senor Colon, an experienced captain	692
Then you cannot ignore that	693
I am, Your Eminence	694
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is	695
Yes, your Eminence.	696
You say Asia can be	697
A waste.	698
What a tragedy.	699
You can see for yourself.	700
On the contrary, Your Eminence.	701
It won't be easy to	702
Indeed.	703
He is a mercenary!	704
Naturally.	705
The Judgment is ours!	706
The State has some reason	707
I can't keep my eyes	708
What is it, now?	709
I am busy inside.	710
Can't you stay with us	711
Not everything.	712
They took everything.	713
They tried.	714
God.	715
I can arrange for the	716
You don't usually ask.	717
Beatrix, I want to ask	718
That's something you can't decide.	719
I don't want you to	720
I'm not asking you to	721
Thank God.	722
She said yes.	723
I find that hard to	724
Perhaps I was never meant	725
I'd love to argue with	726
Are we going to argue?	727
Well.	728
I haven't given you much	729
I know.	730
I could be gone for	731
I am afraid this is	732
How could I be?	733
I am not a seaman.	734
How far from here?	735
Congratulations.	736
Viceroy of the West Indies.	737
Appointment to what?	738
My letters of appointment.	739
Yes.	740
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.	741
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.	742
May I ask by whom?	743
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla --	744
I understand that you will	745
Tell me the first thing	746
Really?	747
I want you to tell	748
He never had one.	749
He asks when he can	750
What does he say?	751
I am not listening, Father.	752
What are you listening to?	753
There must be a passage	754
Father.	755
Not bad.	756
How are you feeling, Fernando?	757
This time with me!	758
I have to explore the	759
Yes.	760
Do you swear on all	761
You promise?	762
There'll be a time.	763
I want to go with	764
All of them created by	765
Roofs.	766
What do you see?	767
Look out of that window.	768
I am not afraid of	769
Call them.	770
All I have to do	771
To rise so high, in	772
What.	773
You seem to have a	774
Good!	775
Don Bobadilla is already a	776
But we do have a	777
for a commoner?	778
You defend yourself admirably.	779
Forgive me, Don Colon.	780
They don't see sin in	781
If you won't accept our	782
And were you never ambitious,	783
Then you are too ambitious.	784
I'm not bargaining!	785
I remind you, Senor Colon,	786
NO.	787
No?	788
No.	789
You never learned how to	790
Utapan, won't you speak to	791
You did the same to	792
You have to find them,	793
Ask him if he will	794
He understands.	795
We will work with his	796
He has medicine.	797
Chief says.	798
and also to bring medicine.	799
Chief says -- he has	800
To bring the word of	801
Why?	802
Thousands.	803
Chief says -- how many?	804
Tell him his country is	805
Chief knows.	806
Tell the Chief we thank	807
You come!	808
Island.	809
What is it?	810
Say not here!	811
I don't know.	812
Oh?	813
New worlds create new people.	814
I knew you would.	815
I have to disagree.	816
You'll always be older than	817
I suppose we're both old	818
Give me absolution.	819
I believed in you.	820
You are bound by an	821
My son, my son.	822
If I tell them, they	823
May God forgive you.	824
I am not sure.	825
How long?	826
I lied.	827
What are you saying?	828
Father, I have betrayed my	829
I am listening, my son.	830
Forgive me, Father.	831
In Nomine Patris et Filius,	832
Colon!	833
All of them!	834
Damn all of you!	835
Colon!	836
Damn God!	837
If God intends you to	838
Wait!	839
You mustn't give way to	840
Only God knows the meaning	841
I've been contradicted all my	842
You get so carried away	843
Passion is something one cannot	844
Father Marchena!	845
I'll try to remember that,	846
Two minutes.	847
So was Christ!	848
Esdras is a Jew.	849
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin	850
How can you be so	851
Ignorance!	852
How can you be so	853
To open a new route	854
Why do you wish to	855
With some difficulty.	856
How did you manage it?	857
That's what it says.	858
God.	859
Father, I am doing what	860
Diego is a bright boy	861
Your Majesty -- some men	862
There is one thing I'd	863
Thank you.	864
But without your brothers.	865
They come and go as	866
Do they have such thoughts?	867
Thirty seven, Your Majesty.	868
How old are you, Senor	869
A woman?	870
I know what I see.	871
You show no inclination to	872
May I speak freely?	873
Surely you can do anything	874
I cannot ignore the verdict	875
That she was impregnable.	876
What did they say about	877
The ocean is uncrossable?	878
No more than the woman	879
I should not even be	880
You will regret this.	881
You'll be held in detention,	882
Savagery is what monkeys understand.	883
In one act of brutality,	884
You did not hear me,	885
Don Moxica -- we all	886
My horse doesn't work.	887
We can't raise the wheel	888
We came here to stay!	889
We don't need to know.	890
You want a war?	891
If you want to keep	892
We lost cousins, friends.	893
The Indians have no such	894
And you say this is	895
We can't be.	896
He's drawing an isthmus.	897
What's he doing?	898
Twenty eight.	899
What do you read?	900
Come over here.	901
Well, I surely know what	902
And what do you think	903
Well.	904
God be with us admiral.	905
Due west, Captain Mendez.	906
You're right.	907
You tell that to them!	908
Pinzon, Pinzon.	909
You bloody.	910
You never did.	911
Jesus Maria!	912
And then what?	913
You don't know anything!	914
The land is there.	915
We're lost!	916
You think I don't know	917
We're on the verge of	918
We have to keep the	919
You must be mad.	920
Six days ago, yes.	921
You lied!	922
Immediately.	923
Where can I meet this	924
Because he is not afraid	925
Then why?	926
I know, I should not	927
And who would you think	928
He must be replaced.	929
Then, what do you suggest,	930
Is this true, Brother Buyl?	931
But there is worse.	932
We weren't expecting immediate profits,	933
Every ship returns with a	934
Yes.	935
Into a monk.	936
Never, Your Majesty.	937
You were right, Don Sanchez.	938
Yes, Your Majesty.	939
Is that the man I	940
Officers, there's your killer, do	941
so we kill someone famous	942
I don't think it's abuse,	943
I'm abused.	944
Can I see your back?	945
Out on my back when	946
Your father put cigarettes out	947
That's what he did to	948
Yeah, he hated me from	949
Your father blamed you for	950
Yeah, yeah.	951
Back in the Czech Republic?	952
Yeah, she went blind giving	953
Your mother was blind?	954
My father always degraded me.	955
Tell me about yourself.	956
Give me another one, please.	957
I need to know about	958
What else do you need?	959
This is not about money,	960
Thirty-percent.	961
But it's.	962
No.	963
I would say.	964
What's your cut?	965
Look, I haven't really focused	966
What about my movie rights?	967
Don't worry about him.	968
No, he is here.	969
Disappeared.	970
What about Oleg?	971
Well, you didn't appreciate the	972
I was all of these.	973
delusions and paranoia.	974
Oh, sure.	975
You bring the cigarettes?	976
I brought you some letters.	977
I'm invoking rights - this	978
Yes.	979
I'm coming with you.	980
Where are we going?	981
Don't say anything.	982
He has the camera!	983
Emil.	984
Oh no!	985
Here.	986
I'm not your lawyer until	987
Are you my attorney?	988
Daphne, I.	989
I don't want to drag	990
Do you really want me	991
Forget about me.	992
Pouring it out!	993
What are you doing?	994
I'll get my clothes.	995
I'll make some for us.	996
In the kitchen.	997
Do you have coffee?	998
Right.	999
